The preface is already intriguing. A tour through the new notation, plus some discussion of why a programming language is the best route in to this stuff. Both of these are extremely powerful ideas, and why I was pulled to this book in the first place.

The functional notation is:

\\[D (\partial\_2 L \circ \Gamma[q]) - (\partial\_1 L \circ \Gamma[q]) = 0
\\]
