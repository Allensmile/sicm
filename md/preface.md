The preface is already intriguing. A tour through the new notation, plus some discussion of why a programming language is the best route in to this stuff. Both of these are extremely powerful ideas, and why I was pulled to this book in the first place.

The functional notation is:

\begin{equation}
D (\partial\_2 L \circ \Gamma[q]) - (\partial\_1 L \circ \Gamma[q]) = 0
\end{equation}

Compare that to the traditional notation:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot q^i} -\frac{\partial L}{\partial q^i}= 0
\end{equation}

They have a nice riff on how this is totally ambiguous.
