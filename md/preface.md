The preface is already intriguing. A tour through the new notation, plus some discussion of why a programming language is the best route in to this stuff. Both of these are extremely powerful ideas, and why I was pulled to this book in the first place.

\begin{equation}
{{1}\over {2}} {{\Delta}\_{v}}^{2} m + {\Delta}\_{v} m D{x}^\prime\left( t \right) + {{1}\over {2}} m {\left( D{x}^\prime\left( t \right) \right)}^{2}
\end{equation}

And this is the end.
