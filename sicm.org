#+title: Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics
#+subtitle: Computational Physics!
#+date: 2020-05-26

Welcome to my tour of Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics. I'm
working on this book to develop my sense of the best way to do research in
public; this book is heavy on math, programming and visualization, and should
stress the normal tools.

I'm attempting to take notes in on org-mode file, and generate all my code from
there. Let's see how it goes!

* 1: Lagrangian Mechanics

This is an example of how we might structure an org-mode file that can export
out to Github flavored Markdown, or to a PDF.

First, let's get some code loaded up and written.

#+begin_src scheme :results none
(load "ch1/utils.scm")

(define (p->r local)
  (let* ((polar-tuple (coordinate local))
         (r (ref polar-tuple 0))
         (phi (ref polar-tuple 1))
         (x (* r (cos phi)))
         (y (* r (sin phi))))
    (up x y)))

(define (spherical->rect local)
  (let* ((spherical-tuple (coordinate local))
         (r (ref spherical-tuple 0))
         (theta (ref spherical-tuple 1))
         (phi (ref spherical-tuple 2)))
    (up (* r (sin theta) (cos phi))
        (* r (sin theta) (sin phi))
        (* r (cos theta)))))
#+end_src

This block will generate a LaTeX version of the code I've supplied:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(->tex-equation
 ((+ (literal-function 'c)
     (D (literal-function 'z)))
  't)
 "eq:masterpiece")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS[b383d2f5d6c252ac04a5f44aaeaec678132b8449]:
\begin{equation}
c\left( t \right) + Dz\left( t \right)
\label{eq:masterpiece}
\end{equation}

You can even reference these with equation numbers, like Equation \eqref{eq:masterpiece} above.

#+begin_src scheme :results value :exports both
(up 1 2 't)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #|
: (up 1 2 t)

*** Equations

Here's a test of $a = bc$ and more $$ \alpha_t $$ equations:

And again this is a thing:

\[
e^{i\pi} = -1
\]

\[
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
\]

*** Concluding.

This is the rest of the goods.

**** Exercise 1.1, p5 and 1.2, p8

For each of the mechanical systems described below, give the number of degrees
of freedom of the configuration space. (Exercise 1.2 asks about the generalized
coordinates of each, so I'll note those here too.)

1. 18 for three juggling pins - 3 position, 3 angles for each. OR 15 total, if
   you assume that the pin is symmetric; then you just need two degrees of tilt.
2. Spherical pendulum,hanging from a fixed support has **two degrees of
   freedom**, one for each angle.
3. Spherical DOUBLE pendulum has **four degrees of freedom**; two angles from
   previous, plus two more angles for the second pendulum off of the first.
4. Point mass sliding without friction on a rigid curved wire == **1 degree of
   freedom**, distance along the wire.
5. Axisymmetric top has **TWO degrees of freedom**, for the angles off of
   vertical. But then we can't talk about its speed, so that's a little strange.
   I guess it has an angular momentum as a property, but that's not a
   coordinate.
6. Same system, not axisymmetric, now has **THREE degrees of freedom**, one more
   for the angle of the top's rotation.
